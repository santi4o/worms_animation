# Worms Animation in C++

Author: Aldo Santiago C.

This is an animation of worms and makes use of gfx (https://www3.nd.edu/~dthain/courses/cse20211/fall2011/gfx/). The worms move in three different ways, straight line, like a snake, and in circles.

Run the makefile with
```
    $ make
```
and then execute the "animation" executable, it will expect an argument which is the number of worms we want to be in the animation, for example
```   
    $ ./animation 100
```
To run this animation you may need to install libx11-dev: 
```
    $ sudo apt install libx11-dev
```

This was a project in school that I wrote in 2019, I remember I had a good time coding and learning OOP with this little project. I was happy with the result, so I wanted to share it.
